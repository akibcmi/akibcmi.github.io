excerpt: 'In this paper, we propose an explanation of representation for self-attention network (SAN) based neural sequence encoders, which regards the information captured by the model and the encoding of the model as graph structure and the generation of these graph structures respectively. The proposed explanation applies to existing works on SAN-based models and can explain the relationship among the ability to capture the structural or linguistic information, depth of model, and length of sentence, and can also be extended to other models such as recurrent neural network based models. We also propose a revisited multigraph called Multi-order-Graph (MoG) based on our explanation to model the graph structures in the SAN-based model as subgraphs in MoG and convert the encoding of the SAN-based model to the generation of MoG. Based on our explanation, we further introduce an MO-Transformer by enhancing the ability to capture multiple subgraphs of different orders and focusing on subgraphs of high orders. Experimental results on multiple neural machine translation tasks show that the MO-Transformer can yield effective performance improvement.'
